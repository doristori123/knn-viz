Halldor wrote all the code for the KNN part of the project. 
Project structure should be fairly self-explanatory:

Main logic is in index.html 
Data generating and handling  functions are in data.js
Heatmap related code is in heatmap.js
and dartboard realted code is in dartboard.js

Files:                                  
index.html - my code
heatmap.js - my code - The heatmap is generated using the same technique that Tensorflow uses (with a canvas elements)
                     - Additionally I used the same color scale and legend as TENSORFLOW. This is clearly marked in the code.
data.js - my code 
kdTree.js - library
dartboard.js - my code (idea for dartboard svg is gotten from a static image at  http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html)
multivariate.normal.min.js - library
high_bias_low_var.png - my screenshot of my own dartboard svg
low_bias_high_var.png  - my screenshot of my own dartboard svg
style.css - my code (Heavily influenced by TensorFlow's UI)
